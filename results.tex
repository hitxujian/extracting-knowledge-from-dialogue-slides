\frametitle{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Independent model achieved better results - 0.73
\item Comparable to models that use whole list of ASR hypothesis
\item Much better performance of both models on the reshuffled data

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item We successfully used the encoder-decoder model for DST task and achieved promising results
\item We verified that DSTC2 difficulty stems from the use of different settings
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item The model could be further improved by employment of other features
\item World-level annotated dataset would help to evaluate the incremental models
\end{itemize}
